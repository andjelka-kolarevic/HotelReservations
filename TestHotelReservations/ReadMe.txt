All test case reservations with expected status are stored in FakeDBReservations class


Note about Complex Requests Case:
	
---	Having in mind the algorithm of checking the availability of rooms from the beginning of the task that with each 
	new reservation the search is performed from the first to the last room, so I made changes to the fifth and eight 
	reservation (Booking5 should be declined and Booking8 accepted)
